        <p>Hi! My name is Mashal. I have over a decade of experience working in education. I am currently a student in the Web
            Development Fellowship at New York Code and Design Academy. What am I doing here? Learning to create dynamic
            applications using JavaScript, JQuery, Sass, Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, and APIs.</p>

        <p>Along with my background in education and web development, I enjoy photography professionally and leisurely (check
            out the photo of the two men in prayer and the breezy flower in the parallax). California has my heart, as you
            can probably tell from my main image - yes, that's me! I love conversing about new and developing technology,
            food, reforming the educational system, and civil rights. I am looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
